## Biol 551 Computer Modeling Repository
>_This repository is a way to organize my data and scripts for transparency._   
_It will hold the data, scripts, and outputs that I gather, learn, and create each week._  
_Each week there will be a new folder added consisting of:_

 * ### Data  
   _These folders will hold the data needed to execute the scripts_

* ### Scripts
  _These folders will hold the scripts created during the Spring 2022 semester_

* ### Output 
  _I'm not sure what these folders will hold yet_
