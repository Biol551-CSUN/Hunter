# Rayshader package

[rayshader](https://www.rayshader.com/)
Rayshader is a package used for 3D and 2D visualization. Itâ€™s functions can be used to create 3D and 2D maps and ggplots! It does so through a series of overlays that when applied on top of each other form a 2D/3D map or plot. Rayrender (a subfeature of rayshader) can also be used to rotate the maps and show your creations from all angles as well as render your creation.
