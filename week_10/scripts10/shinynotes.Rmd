## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
#install.packages("shiny")
```

## Including Plots
everyputput is output$
eg. output$hist<- code  
spell exact same way as in function  
2. code needs to say render a plot with function renderPlot({})  
goes in order so if plot on top then plot wil be on top in app
first create space in user interface ui  
in ui put commas but in output no commas but space  
create something reactive() so that can ineract, goes in server  
data has open and closed () because it's a function because it changes
