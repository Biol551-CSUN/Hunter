```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

read.csv() reads everything as a factor, but the issue is a typo or a mistake 
read_csv reads all as characters, have to tell it to be a factor

```{r}
library(forcats)
library(tidyverse)

starwars %>% 
  filter(!is.na(species)) %>% 
  mutate(species=fct_limp(species, n=3)) %>% 
  count(species, sort = TRUE)
#install.packages("forcats")
```
